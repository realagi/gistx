## Main libs used

Any tool needs some boost, this one is no different, here is a list of the main libs used:

* [React.js](https://github.com/facebook/react) & [Redux](https://redux.js.org/introduction)
* [Redux Saga](https://github.com/redux-saga/redux-saga)
* [React universal component](https://github.com/faceyspacey/react-universal-component)
* [Monaco editor](https://github.com/Microsoft/monaco-editor) & [React monaco editor](https://github.com/superRaytin/react-monaco-editor)
* [Semantic UI React](https://react.semantic-ui.com)
* [Github base](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/github-base)
* [React toastify](https://github.com/fkhadra/react-toastify)


## What is?

It's a easy and faster way to manage your snippets. In fact the applications uses gists (Github) so that also means that you need a Github account.

## How to use?

You can use directly from [here](https://danielmeneses.github.io/gistx/), but it's important to note that this application doesn't use Github's Oauth system because it requires to create an application ID & Secret and that would involve the need of a 24/7 server handling the authentication communication. That said, you should generate a developer token from your Github account.

To get/generate a token, in your Github account you should go to: `Settings -> Developer settings -> Personal tokens` and create a new token allowing access only to `Gists`. Once you have the token place it in the app (it will be required, is the first thing the app requests). The token will be then saved to your browsers `localStorage`.

Note: We don't have access to any of the generated tokens. None of those are saved, read or use in any way. Take a look at the code if any concern still prevails.

## Use it on your own server

Clone this repo and then once in the project run the following commands:

```sh
# install packages
$ npm i

# Run universal production version
$ npm run universal

# Run universal DEV version
$ npm run dev-universal

# Build client only version
$ npm run build-client

# Serve client version
$ npm run serve
```

### Next steps

* Manage gists in local and session storage
* Support tagging gists
* Considering projects auto-docs integration
